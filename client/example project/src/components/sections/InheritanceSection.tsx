        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Definition</h2>
        <p>Object-oriented languages implement reusability of coding structure through inheritance. Inheritance is the second most prominent concept next to encapsulation. It refers to the relationship between classes where one class inherits the entire structure of another class. Inheritance is naturally hierarchical, a tighter relationship than composition and the most highly coupled relationship after friendship.</p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Hierarchies in the Real World</h3>
        <p>For example, the staffing structures in traditional human resource management, with a CEO at the top of the structure, deputies and senior managers beneath that, followed by team leaders and workers. Such structures are useful in making the day to day operations of an organisation manageable. In a retail shop, products are organised and managed in thematic grouping such as hard goods, perishable foods and so on. Such groupings form an integral part of the stock control and checkout management operations. We often use tree diagrams and organograms to capture and visualise these relationships. For example, for the retail shop example:</p>
        <a href="references.html" className="text-blue-600 underline">reference</a> | <a href="https://howtodoinjava.com/java/oops/java-inheritance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 underline">other definitions</a>
        <div className="flex justify-center">
          <OptimizedImage src="/media/inheritance1.webp" alt="Inheritance Example 1" className="my-4" width={400} height={250} loading="lazy" />
        </div>
        <p>In the context of OO design, we are interested in hierarchies that represent the progressive design of a set of classes. The root of our design is a relatively abstract entity, and we build upon that entity to produce progressively more concrete entities. Considering our previous example closer up</p>
        <div className="flex justify-center">
          <OptimizedImage src="/media/inheritance2.webp" alt="Inheritance Example 2" className="my-4" width={400} height={250} loading="lazy" />
        </div>
        <p>We note that the entity of an Item is relatively abstract in the sense that we could not go into a shop and purchase one. If we said to a member of staff that we “wish to purchase an item”, we would expect the response “which item?”. We can purchase specific, or concrete entities, but not those that are relatively abstract in their conceptualisation. But that does not mean that the higher-level entities have no value. They just serve as base definitions onto which we can build more concrete entities. We say that that the higher-level entities are <b>“parent”, “base” or “super”</b> classes, and the lower-level ones built from them are <b>“child”, "derived" or “sub”</b> classes.</p>
      </section>
      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">"is-a" relationship</h2>
        <p>The key idea here is the <b>“is-a”</b> relationship. Looking at our shop example, we see that <b>HardGood is-a Item</b> and that <b>ElectricalGood is-a HardGood</b> and by extension is-a Item. That suggests that, in type terms, ElectricalGood has type ElectricalGood and also has type of HardGood and ultimately Item. This is the kind of hierarchical relationship that Java and other OO programs are designed to capture.</p>
        <p>Not every real-world hierarchy as we might construe it is suited to this kind of super and sub class analysis. Consider the human resources example referred to earlier. The CEO is the head of the organisation, but does not make much sense as a base class. A senior manager is not also the CEO. A team member is not also a senior manager. So instead of the classic staffing organogram that you might be used to seeing, a more appropriate OO relationship might look something like this:</p>
        <div className="flex justify-center">
          <OptimizedImage src="/media/inheritance3.webp" alt="Inheritance Example 3" className="my-4" width={400} height={250} loading="lazy" />
        </div>
        <p>Such an OO compatible hierarchical relationship is an example of the key OO concept of “polymorphism”.</p>
        <p><b>Polymorphism</b> at the class level is the concept that an object can take on more than one form. If an object of class type X has a parent class of type Y, then X can take the form of an object of type either X or Y, and can thus appear in many forms.</p>
      </section>
      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Derived and Super Classes</h2>
        <p>In OO design terms we need to consider what attributes and methods a set of classes share. Where we can identify common attributes and methods, we can factorise the design of those classes so that the commonly shared attributes and methods form part of the super class.</p>
        <p>We will use an example to help us understand how this works. Consider a shop that sells antiques items, namely <b>vases</b>, <b>statues and paintings</b>. For now we shall consider just some appropriate attributes for our initial OO analysis:</p>
        <div className="flex justify-center">
          <OptimizedImage src="/media/inheritance4.webp" alt="Inheritance Example 4" className="my-4" width={400} height={250} loading="lazy" />
        </div>
        <p>We will make three classes for each of the things that our shop sells. We can see that the classes have some attributes in common, and some that are unique to each class. But we can also see that in reality all three classes are examples of <b>“items”</b> — things that the shop sells. So we can factorise our design with an <b>Item superclass</b>, and then make our <b>three specific classes a sub class</b> of that super class. This is beneficial as it reduces un-necessary code duplication (as well as being a better model of a real-world problem).The super and sub class relationship is represented by an arrow pointing from the sub class towards its super class:</p>
        <div className="flex justify-center">
          <OptimizedImage src="/media/inheritance5.webp" alt="Inheritance Example 5" className="my-4" width={400} height={250} loading="lazy" />
        </div>
        <p>To implement the "is-a" relationship of the above class diagram, we use the keyword <b>"extends"</b></p>
        <p>Assume that, these classes are stored in the same package</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Adding Constructors</h2>
        <p>We now know that inheritance allows sub classes to inherit attributes and methods from a super class. We now consider how we should build constructor methods so that instances of our sub classes are created in the most efficient manner.</p>
        <p>Consider the constructors is added to the Vase class.</p>
        <CopyableCodeBlock language="java">
{`public class Vase extends Item
{ 
    private int height;
    private String material;

    public Vase(){

         creator="";
         height=0;
         material="";
    }
    public Vase(int value, String creator, int height, String material){
         this.value=value;

         this.height=height;
         this.material=material;
    }
} 
`}
        </CopyableCodeBlock>
        <p>Because the Vase class has four fields, you can implement constructors that look like the above. But, that is not efficient coding. It would involve code duplication</p>
        <p>To reduce code duplication, common fields are initialized by using constructors of the superclass.</p>
        <p>We edit the code of the Vase class as follows:</p>
        <CopyableCodeBlock language="java">
{`public class Vase extends Item
{ 
    private int height;
    private String material;

    //The below is methods that you need to implement

        super(); //call the default constructor of the Item class
        height=0;
        material="";
    }
    public Vase(int value, String creator, int height, String material){
        super(value, creator);  //call the constructor with 2 parameters of the Item class
        this.height=height;
        this.material=material;
    }

        <p>Similarly, we add constructors to other sub classes</p>
        <p>We use the Java keyword <b>super</b> as the qualifier for calling a superclass method:  <br/><b>super.methodName(arguments);</b></p>
        <p>for example:</p>
        <CopyableCodeBlock language="java">

        <p>In a Vase subclass, The "displayDiscount" method has the same signature (name, plus the number and the type of its parameters) and return type as in the superclass. It is called the override the superclass's method. We will learn the override method in the next topic</p>
