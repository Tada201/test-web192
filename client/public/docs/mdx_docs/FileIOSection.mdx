# Standard Input and Output

This topic covers the Java platform classes used for basic input and output. It focuses primarily on I/O Streams, a powerful concept that greatly simplifies I/O operations.

## I/O Stream

An I/O Stream represents an input source or an output destination. A stream can represent many different kinds of sources and destinations, including disk files, devices, other programs, and memory arrays.

Streams support many different kinds of data, including simple bytes, primitive data types, localized characters, and objects. Some streams simply pass on data; others manipulate and transform the data in useful ways.

*For more details, see the [Java I/O Streams documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/streams.html).*

## I/O from the Command Line

A program is often run from the command line and interacts with the user in the command line environment. The Java platform supports this kind of interaction in two ways: through the Standard Streams and through the Console.

The Java platform supports three Standard Streams:
- **Standard Input**: accessed through `System.in`
- **Standard Output**: accessed through `System.out`
- **Standard Error**: accessed through `System.err`

These objects are defined automatically and do not need to be opened. Standard Output and Standard Error are both for output; having error output separately allows the user to divert regular output to a file and still be able to read error messages. For more information, refer to the [documentation for your command line interpreter](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/cl.html).

To get user input, we can also use the `Scanner` class. *[See more about Scanner](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/scanning.html).* This class supports methods to get various types from the user:

| Method         | Description                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| nextBoolean()  | Reads a boolean value from the user |
| nextByte()     | Reads a byte value from the user    |
| nextDouble()   | Reads a double value from the user  |
| nextFloat()    | Reads a float value from the user   |
| nextInt()      | Reads an int value from the user    |
| nextLine()     | Reads a String value from the user  |
| nextLong()     | Reads a long value from the user    |
| nextShort()    | Reads a short value from the user   |

## Example

![Java I/O Example](/media/ioexample.webp)

In the above example, we need to import the library class `Scanner` from the package `java.util.Scanner`. At line 10, we declare the variable `sc` and create an object from this class. At line 11, a message "Enter number of elements" is printed. At line 12, the statement `sc.nextLine()` gets a string from the user, and then we use `Integer.parseInt()` to convert the inputted string to an integer value. At line 19, `System.out.format` is used in Java to format output.

## Summary

- The easiest way to get user data is to use the library class `Scanner`.
- Use `System.out` to print data to the console.
- Convert a string to a number using classes like `Integer`, `Float`, etc.

# Reading from a File

```java
try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("input.txt"))) {
    String line;
    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
        System.out.println(line);
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
